1. Standard module installation applies. You will need to visit the settings 
   page and save settings before the module can be used.

2. The Settings pages can be found at "admin >> site configuration >> redmine issuer"
   "http://www.example.com/admin/settings/redmine_issuer"

   Set Projects, Trackers, Statuses and Priorities to reflect options on your Redmine 
   installation.  Of course you can use a subset of options in the Redmine Issuer 
   module.  Issue sent with options that aren't valid in your Redmine installation 
   are likely to be silently ignored, so it really does behoove you to check.

3. All settings are pretty much global for now, so if you have multiple Redmine 
   installs you want to hit or significant per-project differences, feel free to 
   extend this module. 
   
   That's pretty much it.
